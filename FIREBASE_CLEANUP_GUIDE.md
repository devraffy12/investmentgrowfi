# FIREBASE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES CLEANUP GUIDE

## PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
Your Render environment seems to have BOTH individual Firebase variables AND the JSON variable set, causing conflicts.

## SOLUTION - CLEAN UP RENDER ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:

### 1. GO TO RENDER DASHBOARD:
- https://dashboard.render.com/
- Click your `investmentgrowfi` service
- Go to **Environment** tab

### 2. DELETE THESE INDIVIDUAL VARIABLES (if they exist):
```
FIREBASE_TYPE
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID  
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY_ID
FIREBASE_CLIENT_ID
FIREBASE_AUTH_URI
FIREBASE_TOKEN_URI
FIREBASE_AUTH_PROVIDER_X509_CERT_URL
FIREBASE_CLIENT_X509_CERT_URL
FIREBASE_UNIVERSE_DOMAIN
```

### 3. KEEP ONLY THESE TWO VARIABLES:
```
FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_JSON = (the long JSON string)
FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL = https://investment-6d6f7-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com
```

### 4. VERIFY FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_JSON:
Make sure the value starts with:
```
{"type":"service_account","project_id":"investment-6d6f7"...
```

### 5. REDEPLOY:
Click "Manual Deploy" after cleaning up the environment variables.

## WHY THIS FIXES IT:
- The code tries individual variables first
- If individual variables exist but are invalid, it fails
- If individual variables don't exist, it tries JSON (which should work)
- Having both creates conflicts

## EXPECTED RESULT AFTER CLEANUP:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è No JSON credentials found in environment variables
‚úÖ FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_JSON: Found (2370 chars)
‚úÖ JSON parsing: Success
üî• Firebase initialized with JSON environment credentials
‚úÖ Project ID: investment-6d6f7
üî• Firebase Status: ‚úÖ Available
```
