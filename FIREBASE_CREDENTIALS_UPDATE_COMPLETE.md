## Summary of Changes

Your Firebase configuration has been successfully updated with the new service account key across all necessary files:

### 1. Files Updated:
- ‚úÖ `firebase-service-account.json` - Local development file
- ‚úÖ `.env` - Environment variables for local development
- ‚úÖ All code references to Firebase are already compatible

### 2. Local Development:
Your local development is now working properly with the new Firebase credentials:
- Project ID: `investment-6d6f7`
- Private Key ID: `ecd0afac04d2aedc359bbffe13e9f8a0585fe74b`
- Client Email: `firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@investment-6d6f7.iam.gserviceaccount.com`

### 3. Production Deployment (Render.com):
To update your production deployment, follow these steps:

1. **Go to your Render.com dashboard**
2. **Navigate to your web service settings**
3. **Go to Environment Variables section**
4. **Update the existing environment variable:**

2. Copy the generated JSON string (starts with `{"type":"service_account"...`)
3. Paste it as the value for `FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_JSON` in Render.com

**Important:** Do not include the credentials in version control for security reasons.
