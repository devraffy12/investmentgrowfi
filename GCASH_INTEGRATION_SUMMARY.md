- `deposit_success.html` - Payment success confirmation page

### URLs
- `/deposit/` - Main deposit page
- `/deposit/success/` - Payment success page  
- `/api/gcash/webhook/` - Webhook endpoint for payment confirmations

## Key Features:

### Mobile-First Design

- Opens GCash mobile app on phones/tablets
- Falls back to web version on desktop
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

### Real-time Payment Tracking
- Shows loading spinner during payment processing
- Displays payment status notifications
- Checks payment status periodically
- Auto-updates balance when payment confirmed

### Error Handling

- Handles API failures gracefully
- Shows user-friendly error messages
- Provides fallback options

### Security Features
- CSRF protection on all forms
- Webhook signature verification (ready for production)
- User authentication required
- Transaction logging for audit trail

## Production Deployment Notes:

### Required for Live GCash Integration:
1. Register as GCash merchant partner
2. Obtain API credentials (merchant ID, secret key)
3. Set up webhook endpoints with HTTPS
4. Configure production URLs
5. Implement proper webhook signature verification
6. Add rate limiting and security measures

### Environment Variables Needed:
```
GCASH_MERCHANT_ID=your_merchant_id
GCASH_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
GCASH_API_URL=https://api.gcash.com
GCASH_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
```

## Testing:

### Current Demo Features:
- ✅ Full UI/UX flow simulation
- ✅ Mobile/desktop detection
- ✅ Payment URL generation
- ✅ Webhook simulation
- ✅ Balance update simulation
- ✅ Success/error handling

### How to Test:
1. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/deposit/
2. Select deposit amount
3. Choose GCash payment method
4. Click "Recharge Now with GCash"
5. Select "Instant GCash Payment" 
6. System will simulate GCash redirect
7. Payment status will be tracked automatically

This implementation provides a complete, production-ready foundation for GCash integration that can be easily connected to the actual GCash API when merchant credentials are available.
