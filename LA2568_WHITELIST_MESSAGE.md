**Subject: Urgent - IP Whitelist Request for Merchant RodolfHitler**

Dear LA2568 Support Team,

I am experiencing a whitelist error when making API calls to your payment gateway. I need to request IP whitelisting for my merchant account.

**ERROR MESSAGE:**
```
"Not added to the api whitelist:QXBpQ29udHJvbGxlci5waHA=:682"
```

**MERCHANT ACCOUNT DETAILS:**
- Merchant ID: `RodolfHitler`
- Secret Key: `86cb40fe1666b41eb0ad21577d66baef`
- Platform: Django Investment Application
- Domain: `https://investmentgrowfi.onrender.com`

**IP ADDRESSES TO WHITELIST:**

**Production Server IPs (Render.com Outbound):**
```
44.229.227.142
54.188.71.94
52.13.128.108
```

**Development/Testing IP:**
```
180.190.127.16
```

**CALLBACK URLS:**
- Callback URL: `https://investmentgrowfi.onrender.com/payment/callback/`
- Success URL: `https://investmentgrowfi.onrender.com/payment/success/`
- Cancel URL: `https://investmentgrowfi.onrender.com/payment/cancel/`

**PAYMENT METHODS CONFIGURED:**
- GCash QR: `payment_type=1, bank_code=gcash`
- GCash H5: `payment_type=7, bank_code=mya`
- PayMaya: `payment_type=3, bank_code=PMP`

**TECHNICAL DETAILS:**
My Django application is hosted on Render.com which uses the above static outbound IP addresses for all external API calls. These IPs need to be whitelisted on your system to allow my application to successfully communicate with your payment API.

**REQUEST:**
Please whitelist the above IP addresses for my merchant account so that I can process payments through your gateway. 

**CONFIRMATION:**
Please confirm when the whitelisting is complete so I can test the integration and ensure everything is working properly.

Thank you for your assistance. I look forward to your prompt response.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Merchant: RodolfHitler
Platform: InvestmentGrowFi
