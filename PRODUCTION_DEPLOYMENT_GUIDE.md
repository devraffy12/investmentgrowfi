### 4. Firebase Integration

- ✅ Comprehensive referral data saved to Firebase
- ✅ Referral code lookup functionality added

## 🔧 PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### Step 1: Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix referral system for production deployment

- Fixed NOT NULL constraint error on investment_id
- Enhanced error handling for Firebase and database operations
- Added comprehensive logging for production debugging
- Made referral commission creation more robust
- Registration now continues even if Firebase fails"

git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Update Render Environment Variables
Add these environment variables in Render dashboard:

```
FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_FILE=/path/to/firebase/credentials.json
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/firebase/credentials.json
```

Or upload Firebase credentials as a file in Render.

### Step 3: Database Migration on Render
The migration will run automatically during deployment, but if needed:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### Step 4: Test Referral Codes on Production
Available referral codes for testing:
- A503D678
- 04F0F718
- 822CDC49
- 609265C9
- 2E246D76

### Issue: Firebase Errors
**Root Cause:** Missing credentials in production
**Solution:** Add Firebase credentials to Render environment variables
**Status:** ✅ Non-blocking - Registration continues without Firebase

### Issue: Registration Fails After Validation
**Root Cause:** Database errors in referral commission creation
**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Added comprehensive error handling

## 📊 MONITORING CHECKLIST

After deployment, check these logs on Render:

1. ✅ Look for: "✅ Valid referral code found"
2. ✅ Look for: "✅ Referral commission created"
3. ✅ Look for: "💰 Referral bonus awarded"
4. ⚠️ Watch for: Any database constraint errors
5. ⚠️ Watch for: Firebase connection issues (non-critical)

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

- ✅ Referrer receives ₱15 bonus
- ✅ User receives ₱100 registration bonus
- ✅ Both users can access dashboard
- ✅ Referral commission is created in database
- ✅ System works even if Firebase is unavailable
